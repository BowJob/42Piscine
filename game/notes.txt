1. Clear screens with: #include <stdlib.h>

with prototype:
int system(const char *command);

then call system using:
system("clear");

Having this in main and inside a loop will clear the screen, establishing frames.

2. Set frames with

system("sleep .1"); <--- this will make system wait for 0.1 seconds before continuing routine.
